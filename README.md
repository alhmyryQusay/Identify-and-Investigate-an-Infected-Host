# Identify and Investigate an Infected Host

## Project Overview
In this project, I investigated a potentially compromised **Windows host** belonging to the HR department.  
An **IDS alert** indicated suspicious process execution activity, suggesting a possible malware infection.  
Due to limited resources, only **process creation logs (Event ID: 4688)** were collected and ingested into **Splunk** under the index `win_eventlogs` for further analysis.

## Key Highlights
- Investigated a potentially compromised host in a Windows environment.
- Analyzed process creation logs (Event ID: 4688) to detect suspicious activity.
- Applied Splunk SIEM for log ingestion and analysis.
- Demonstrated skills in malware detection and incident investigation.

## Tools & Data Sources
- **Splunk SIEM**  
- **Windows Event Logs** – Event ID 4688 (Process Creation)  
- **Index:** win_eventlogs
